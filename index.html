        Welcome to Lucy's Miku GIF website!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hello and welcome! I'm Sushi Lucy, and this is my Miku GIF website. 
    </p>

    (ahh, so cute!)
    </p>
    <p>
    Go check out the GIFs above! It's just a whole bunch of GIFs I found on the internet.

        INFO
    </p>
    <p>
        I made this website because I want the internet to... partially recognize me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I couldn't think of any themes for this website,
    </p>

    <p>
        but my friend (whom I will not name for her privacy) thought of of the Miku theme. She's obssesed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would have never thought of Miku GIFs (even though I love Miku 🩵).
